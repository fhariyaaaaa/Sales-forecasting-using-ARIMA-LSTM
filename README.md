# Sales-forecasting-using-ARIMA-LSTM
Sales Forecasting with ARIMA and LSTM
Overview
This project aims to demonstrate sales forecasting using two popular time series analysis methods: ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. By comparing these methods, we can evaluate their effectiveness in forecasting sales data, which is crucial for strategic planning in business contexts.
